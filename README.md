## ML Model Examples Project
Overview
This project showcases data visualization and machine learning model experimentation on 15 different datasets. We explored 2-3 different models for each dataset and recorded their train and test accuracy values.


## Notebooks
Each notebook (.ipynb file) contains the following:

Data Visualization: Visual representations of the dataset to understand underlying patterns.
Model Training: Application of 2-3 different machine learning models.
Accuracy Evaluation: Calculation and comparison of train and test accuracy for each model.

## Results
The Results folder contains text files for each dataset. These files include the following information:

Summary of data visualization insights.
Details of models used.
Train and test accuracy values.
